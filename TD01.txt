WHEN HE DIED

When he died
Turns out he left behind
A mansion full of other people's skulls
The odd thing is, they never found his own when he died
When he died
He somehow left behind
Strange symbols on the floor beneath his corpse
Investigators said the wood was scorched when he died
When he died
They found so many scorpions inside his lungs
When he died
The statues of his missing children cried
What was later found to be his blood
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
They telephoned his wife (who reacted with delight)
But gradually her voice began to fade to nothing
And the laughing record played, the laughing record played
When he died
They found a message etched into his spine
That said when he died
An endless age of untold nightmares would be nigh
And the blood would make the seas run red
When he died (on a dark and stormy night)
A nearby shed caught fire (it simply caught alight)
And when they cleared the charred wood from the ground
Inside they found a painting of a clown (a creepy painting of a clown)
He'd painted it when he was just a child
But scrawled upon the back was exactly when he died
When he died
When he died
When he died
When he died



TOUCH-TONE TELEPHONE

I think it's time
For you to know
The awful truth
The truth about me, and the truth about you
'Cause you're a brand new species
Big cat (uh, oh)
Space Nazis, Robert Stack (uh, oh)
God damn it, gonna snap (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Leonard Nimoy, call me back (call me back)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
Oh, I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
'Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh, my God
I try and I try and I try (to make you listen to me)
I try to call you everyday
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
'Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one (hey)
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
Don't hang up yet, I'm not done
I'm an expert, I'm the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong
I'm an expert in my field
Ufology, yes, it's all real
Ancient aliens, it's all true
I'm an expert just like you
And like you, I'm a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that's the real crime
Pretty soon they'll discover me
In the Super-Sargasso Sea
I try to call you everyday
What can I say?
When the truth comes out (of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out (now, now, now)
'Cause I'm the right one
(On my touch-tone telephone) on my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
(I'm the only one on your A.M. Radio) I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. Radio
